It’s a feature built right into the browser that allows you to synchronize your bookmarks, passwords, browsing history, personal data, and other things so that you can seamlessly access them on every computer or device where you’re using Microsoft Edge.

## How to sign into Edge with a Microsoft account?

Before you can start syncing Edge data between devices, you must be signed into your PC using a Microsoft account. When you set up your PC for the first time, if you signed in with your Microsoft account, you can move on to the next section. If not, follow these steps:

* Click the Start button.
* Click the Settings button. (It looks like a gear.)
* Click Accounts.
* Click Sign in with a Microsoft account instead.
* Type the email address associated with your Microsoft account and hit Tab on your keyboard.
* Type your password.
* Click Sign in.

## How to sync Microsoft Edge on a Windows PC

* The first step is to start Microsoft Edge and access its settings. To do that, open the “Settings and More” menu by clicking or tapping on the three dots button found in the browser’s top-right corner.
* In the browser’s menu, look for the Settings option and click or tap on it.
* The previous action opens a new tab where Edge gives you access to all its settings. In it, click or tap on the Sync option from the Profiles section.
* Then, you should see your Microsoft account and only one option for it: “Turn on sync.” Click or tap the “Turn on sync” button.
* For each type of data you want to sync in Microsoft Edge, turn the corresponding switch found on its right side.
* Once you finish choosing what you want to sync, press the Confirm button at the top of the Edge Sync page.
* And that’s it! Starting from now on, Microsoft Edge synchronizes all the things you’ve chosen, so you can easily carry on with your browsing on all the other computers and devices where you use this web browser.

## How to sync Microsoft Edge on Android

* In the list of options displayed by Edge, tap Settings on the right.
* This makes Edge show the Settings screen. On it, scroll if you need to find the Accounts section and tap on your Microsoft account.
* Now Edge should show you a new screen with a few options for your Account. On it, there’s a section called Sync settings and, in it, a Sync option. Tap on it.
* You’ve reached Edge’s Sync settings screen. The first thing on it is the Sync switch. To make your browser synchronize across all your smartphones, computers, and devices, turn the Sync switch on.
* Once you’ve enabled Sync, you can choose what exactly you want to be synchronized. To do that, in the Data items section, tap to select all the things you’d like to sync: Favorites, Open tabs, Form fill, Passwords, Collections, and History.
* You can now exit the Settings of Edge for Android and start enjoying the browser’s syncing feature on all the devices and computers where you’ve turned it on.
